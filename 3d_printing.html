    <h2 id="origin_story">My exposure to 3D printing</h2>
      <div class="origin">
        <p>My first time seeing a 3D printer was senior year of highschool but I did not think too much of it at the time since I thought it was too complicated to learn how to operate one. 
        When I began my freshman year at Illinois Tech I was introduced to the 3D printers in RE and began to wonder if I would be able to design my own things and print them but again did not have a 
        strong desire to pursue it. It was in sophomore year of university when my friend mentioned he had gotten a 3D printer and that MicroCenter had a great deal on one called the Creality Ender 3 V2.
        That is when I decided to dabble in 3D printing and began to learn more about it alongside with my friend. Putting the kit together was fairly easy and learning what filament material was ideal for what I wanted to 
        print was a breeze as well. The hardest part in learning how to use one was leveling the adhesion bed and getting the sample 3D prints to adhere to the bed nicely by testing different bed temperatures. After a couple of weeks I 
        began getting comfortable with using the printer&comma; using the relevant software to modify the print as needed and converting .stl files into .gcode files which is the only file type the 3D printer will read.</p>

    <h2 id="dcad">3D printing from CAD modeling</h2>
      <div class="dmodel">
        <p>At first I had only 3D printed files I had found online via websites such as <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com" title="Go to Thingiverse"><strong>Thingiverse.com</strong></a></p>
        <p>It took a while before I was able to implement printing my own CAD models since I was not well versed in using CAD software at the time. Just recently within the last 2 semesters is when I began using 
        CAD modeling software such as AutoDesk Inventor and Creo more frequently in coursework in which I feel comfortable using now. My next goal was to be able to 3D print CAD models I designed which I know was possible.
        All I had to do was to convert the Creo .prt files to .stl files&comma; import them into the slicer program for the 3D printer&comma; modify it if needed and then export it onto a micro-SD card as a .gcode file. 
	An example of one of my more recent prints is a screw clamp cup holder for my desk with a headphone hook that I modeled in Creo. The first prints usually don&apos;t go as planned where parts don&apos;t fit how you&apos;d like and thus requires
	micro adjustments in the CAD modeling of the object in which you would need to reprint that part which takes time of course. Overall&comma; I find it satisfying to be able to design a product&comma; even if it is as simple as a cup holder
	and bring it to fruition. A picture of my CAD model is pictured below&colon;</p>

      <div class="printedprod">
        <p>This print took a total of 28 hours to finish and the end result was satisfactory besides some issues with supports. When 3-D printing&comma; supports are typically needed to help support parts of the print that can&apos;t be
	   printed into thin air. The problem with supports is that they skew the final print with excess material that is troublesome to remove. As of now&comma; I use tools such as exacto knives&comma; pliers and sandpaper to remove the supports.
    	   However&comma; it hard to remove the supports to make the final product perfect or without noticeble excess material. As you can see below&comma; there are parts of the prints that look rough or rigid since the supports are essentially
	   bounded to the body of the main print. It will take some time before I can master figuring out the appropriate slicer configurations that differ from print to print to make the supports easier to remove that would result in a 
	   clean and &quot;smooth&quot; final print.</p>
