    <h2>Derrick Rose</h2>
      <div class="drose"> 
        <p>As a Chicago native&comma; I was and still am a die hard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Rose"><strong>Derrick Rose</strong></a> fan. I followed Rose&apos;s journey from when he was in highschool
        at Simeon Career Academy watching highlight mixtapes on Youtube. After highschool&comma; I watched him play a year in college at The University of Memphis in which after he entered the NBA draft and was selected
        as the Number 1 pick of the 2008 draft by the Chicago Bulls. As far as I could tell&comma; bringing a &num;1 pick who was a Chicago native to the Bulls franchise was an exciting thing to say the least. As a basketball 
        fan growing up&comma; watching D. Rose&apos;s explosiveness and agility was always exhilarating. The Bulls after the Jordan era wasn&apos;t doing too well and Derrick Rose gave the team new found hope after he decided to do
        his thing and become the league&apos;s youngest MVP at 22 years old in his 3rd season. In that same MVP year&comma; Rose led the Bulls to the Eastern Conference Finals&comma; in which they have not been there in years. 
        Unfortunately&comma; they had lost to the Miami Heat led by Lebron James. This was as far Rose had gotten in the playoffs before he tragically tore his ACL the following year in the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers. 
        After recovering the following years&comma; he has bounced from team to team but has worked on body recovery tremedously and has found a solid role on his current team of the New York Knicks.</p>

    <h2>Dwayne Wade</h2>
      <div class="wade">
        <p>Around the same time I started watching Derrick Rose&comma; I quickly became a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade"><strong>Dwayne Wade</strong></a> who also is a Chicago native but was drafted 
        5th overall in 2006 by the Miami Heat. Dwayne Wade&comma; nicknamed the &quot;Flash&quot; was a shifty and dominant shooting guard who won his first NBA championship in 2006 with the Miami Heat. However&comma; I was only 6 at that time
        so the Dwayne Wade I grew up admiring was the 2008 and on version. After beating Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals&comma; the Heat had advacned to the Finals where they lost 4-2 to 
        the Dallas Mavericks. After the 2011 defeat to the Mavs&comma; Dwayne Wade and the Heat went on to win back to back championships with the help of LeBron James and Chris Bosh in 2012 and 2013. After countless All-Star
        appearances&comma; Dwayne Wade retired as one of the greatest to do it and a Miami Heat legend in 2019.</p>

    <h2>Paul George</h2>
      <div class="pg_">
        <p>Similarly&comma; along side watching Rose and Wade clash it out&comma; there was another team in the East that had high potential and was led by another favorite player of mine growing up who goes by the name of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George"><strong>Paul George</strong></a>. Paul George was drafted 10th overall in the 2010 NBA draft by the Indiana Pacers and has since then moved on to play for 2 more teams.
        It was Paul George on the Indiana Pacers in which I became a big fan&comma; admiring his play style and trying to apply that same style to when I play. Seeing his progression throughout the years was fascinating as there
        were multiple years he was a top contender for the MVP award. In the 2012 and 2013 seasons&comma; George had helped lead the Pacers to two eastern conference finals where they were met with defeat by the Miami Heat&apos;s big three.
        In 2014&comma; George decided to switch his jersey number from 24 to 13 where he was dubbed the nickname PG-13. After a couple more seasons on the Pacers&comma; George joined the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2017 after playing his last 7 
        seasons with the Pacers. On the Thunder&comma; he had started to pick up the pace stats wise playing some of the best basketball of his career but had no luck in the playoffs. After 2 seasons on the Thunder&comma; he went on to play 
        with Kawhi Leonard on the Los Angeles Clippers where he also had put up all star numbers and has been playing at an all star level living up to his post-season nickname of &quot;Playoff-P&quot;. Seven years after his last apperance in 
        a conference finals&comma; Paul George and the Clippers made it to western conference finals in the 2020 season. Paul George is still one of my favorite players to watch til this day.</p>
